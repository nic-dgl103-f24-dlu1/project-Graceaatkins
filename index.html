    <h2> How It Started</h2>
    <p>Kitty Coleman Woodland Gardens are an act of love, developed by one man in an effort to fulfill a dream to share with all. Bryan Zimmerman's Xmas Tree Farm and Santa's Barn are well-known in the Comox Valley during the winter months. He always knew he lived in a beautiful spot but it wasn't until he began clearing out some of the thick brush on his 24 acres of forested land that he thought of a way to share it with others.

      Studying the interesting topography and unique layout gave him the idea for creating the woodland gardens. Over the next two years he began to build his wonderland dream clearing the underbrush by hand to reveal a forest floor more beautiful than he had imagined.
      
      Day by day, using his back and wheelbarrow, he laid over a mile of bark mulch paths meandering through the woods. Unwilling to disturb plant and tree root systems more than absolutely necessary or to use heavy equipment which would destroy the landscape, he dragged all brush and debris out manually.
      
      The beauty of the gardens is that most of the forests natural finery has been left alone, embellished, but not overwhelmed by cultivation. The gardens are especially designed to showcase the most beautiful of all shrubs: the rhododendron. Bryan has planted over 3000 rhododendrons of different varieties and sizes as well as companion plants and cultivated trees, all blending into the breathtakingly beautiful natural surroundings. </p>
